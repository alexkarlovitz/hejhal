\title{Recentish Results}

In this document, I collect results from tests using the faster, better organized version of the Python code.

\section*{Tests for Hejhal's Algorithm}

The code assumes we are working on a Hecke triangle group generated by $z \mapsto z + 1$ and $z \mapsto -R^2/z$ for some $R > 0$.
Here are a few values of $R$ and corresponding $\nu$ values which are known to come from a true Maass form.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $R = 1$, $\nu = i9.5336952613\dots$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item this is the group $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$
	\end{itemize}
	\item $R = 1/\sqrt{2}$, $\nu = i7.220872\dots$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item this is the congruence group $\Gamma_4$
	\end{itemize}
	\item $R = 1/\sqrt{2}$, $\nu = i11.317680\dots$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item this is also the congruence group $\Gamma_4$, just a different eigenvalue
	\end{itemize}
	\item $R = 7/20$, $\nu = 0.26705241700910205677150208864259506276668(7)\dots$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item note that this is an infinite volume fundamental domain, since $7/20 < 1/2$
		\item note that $\nu$ is real in this example
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ideas to Test the Disk Model}

I have been attempting tests to determine what is going wrong with the disk model.
Here are some tests that might give some information.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run both models (upper half plane and disk) with a correct eigenvalue as input.
	The linear system should thus return approximately correct Fourier coefficients.
	Use these coefficients to evaluate the Maass form at some points.
	Just checking at one point is not enough, since the Maass form is only unique up to scaling.
	So check the ratio at two points, and check if the two models give the same value.
	\item Run the disk model with the correct eigenvalue as input.
	Check that the Fourier coefficients given by the two sets of test points (at different $\rho$ values) are close to each other.
	\item Use the coefficients from the upper half plane model (which I know are correct, since they match those found on Str\"ombergsson's website) to evaluate the Maass form at a collection of test points.
	Set up a linear system for the expansion in the disk model to solve for those Fourier coefficients.
	This should give the correct Foruier coefficients, since the function values are verified to be approximately correct.
	\item Put the correct coefficients obtained from test 3 into the linear system for the disk model.
	They should solve the linear system.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Dec 8 2019}

I ran the ratio test (test 1 above) with the following input:
$$
(D, M_0, N, R, Y_1, \rho_1) = (100, 100, 250, 1, 1/3, 1/2)
$$
The results were:
Ratio for UHP:
$$
(-0.1537167192 + 0.000000000000000290359490i)
$$
Ratio for Disk:
$$
(-0.1502925464 + 0.005967181881i)
$$
So these are reasonably close!
\\

I ran the test again with the following input:
$$
(D, M_0, N, R, Y_1, \rho_1) = (100, 100, 250, 1, 1/3, 1/2)
$$
(so I just changed the radius $\rho_1$).
The results were:
Ratio for UHP:
$$
(-0.1537167192 + 0.0000000000000002903594904i)
$$
Ratio for Disk:
$$
(-0.1537167191 - 0.0000000001309977764i) 
$$
This did a lot better!

\section*{Thoughts}

It appears that decreasing $N$, the number of test points, caused the algorithm in the disk model to fail.
So the next test will be to try higher values of $N$.
